MandarinOS Developer Handoff
Author: Raymond Young
Pack: MandarinOS Core
Version: 1.0
Language: zh-Hans (Simplified Chinese)

1. System Philosophy
MandarinOS is a conversation-first, visual-first, word-first Mandarin learning system.
Core design principles:
1. Words are the unit of utility
o Characters are visual support units
o Radicals are visual decoding units
o Words are what users actually speak and understand
2. Conversation drives retention
o Users learn through meaningful conversation loops
o Boring sentences like “The sky is blue” are avoided
o Engines simulate real social conversation
3. Visual language model
o Chinese is treated as a visual language
o Radicals and components are used for comprehension
o Handwriting input is first-class
4. Frequency + relatedness
o Words are introduced by frequency priority
o Related words, characters, and radicals are clustered
5. Spaced repetition is mandatory
o SM-2 algorithm
o 10-minute daily sessions
o Diagnostic-driven scheduling

2. Learning Architecture
The system is built around Phases, Engines, Frames, and Words.
Phases
Phases define learning depth:
PhaseGoalP1Survival conversationP2Daily life & social independenceP3(future) Fluency expansionP4(future) Native-like comprehension
3. Conversation Engines
Each phase has Conversation Engines.
Engines represent real-life conversational domains:
* Identity (name, background)
* Place (where you live, lifestyle)
* Family (relationships)
* Work (routine, challenges)
* Hobby (interests)
* Travel (experiences)
* Life (planning, opinions, stories)
Engines are defined in:
p1_engines.json
p2_engines.json
Each engine defines:
* Entry frames
* Follow-up frames
* Slot sources
* Mastery checks
* Routing rules
Engines are used by:
* Session planner
* Diagnostic router
* SRS scheduler

4. Sentence Frames
Frames are sentence templates with variable slots.
Example:
? ? {name}
Slots are filled using fillers:
fillers.names
Frames are defined in:
p1_frames.json
p2_frames.json
Frames are:
* The main teaching unit
* Used for production drills
* Used for comprehension drills
* Used for conversation simulation

5. Fillers
Fillers provide real-world vocabulary for frames.
Examples:
* Names
* Cities
* Jobs
* Hobbies
* Times
* Actions
* Food
* Places
Fillers are defined in:
p1_fillers.json
p2_fillers.json
They prevent boring sentences and allow:
* Endless sentence variation
* Natural conversation feel
* High memorability

6. Word Spine
Words are introduced via bundles:
Each bundle:
* Introduces 1 new word
* Uses 2+ frames that contain that word
* Uses previously known words
Words are defined in:
p1_words.json
p2_words.json
Each word contains:
* Frequency rank
* HSK level
* Phase
* Frame IDs
* Meaning
* Pinyin
* Tags

7. Visual Language Layer
Chinese is treated as a visual language.
Radicals
25 high-coverage radicals form the visual decoding layer.
Defined in:
radicals_core.json
Used for:
* Radical drills
* Character decomposition
* Visual recognition training

Characters
1200 core characters with:
* Frequency rank
* Stroke count
* Radical
* Components
* Etymology
* Mnemonics
* Confusables
* Handwriting support
Defined in:
characters_1200.json
Characters are support units, not primary learning units.

Word–Character Links
This connects the word system to the visual system.
Defined in:
word_character_links.json
Allows:
* Word ? character support
* Character ? word reinforcement
* Error-driven character scheduling

8. Spaced Repetition (SM-2)
SM-2 is configured in:
srs_config.json
Features:
* 10-minute daily session policy
* Adaptive scheduling
* Ease factor
* Interval growth
* Failure decay
* Diagnostic priority
Items scheduled:
* Words
* Frames
* Radicals
* Characters (optional support)

9. Diagnostic Engine
Diagnostics place users at the correct level and detect gaps.
Defined in:
diagnostic_p1.json
diagnostic_p2.json
Diagnostics test:
* Frame production
* Frame comprehension
* Core word knowledge
* Engine readiness
Used for:
* Phase placement
* Engine routing
* Weakness targeting

10. Import System
Entry Point
content_manifest.json
Pack Metadata
pack_meta.json
Import Order
import_order.json
Validation Rules
import_validation_rules.json
Runtime Indexes
runtime_indexes.json
These guarantee:
* Deterministic loading
* Reference integrity
* Schema validation
* Stable ID mapping
* Backward compatibility

11. ID Mapping
If the app already has an internal ID system:
id_map.json
Allows:
* External content IDs ? internal IDs
* Stable SRS history
* Incremental migration
Null = use content ID as internal ID.

12. Runtime Indexes
Derived at import time:
* word ? frames
* frame ? words
* engine ? frames
* phase ? engines
* word ? characters
* character ? words
* radical ? characters
* confusion sets
Defined in:
runtime_indexes.json

13. Session Flow
Each 10-minute session:
1. Diagnostic check (if new or weak area)
2. Select engine loop
3. Pull due SRS items
4. Generate frames
5. Inject fillers
6. Run production drills
7. Run comprehension drills
8. Update SM-2 state

14. Visual Learning Flow
When handwriting mode is enabled:
* Characters appear with:
o Radical highlighted
o Components separated
o Stroke order hints
* Radical drills are scheduled
* Confusable sets are used
* Error-driven character support is injected

15. Design Outcome
This architecture creates:
* Conversation-driven learning
* Visual decoding of Chinese
* Memory retention through repetition
* Natural speaking ability
* High learner motivation
This is not a vocabulary app.
This is not a grammar app.
This is a conversation operating system for Mandarin.

16. Implementation Notes
* All files are UTF-8
* Strict JSON (no comments)
* No trailing commas
* Deterministic import
* Schema versioning supported
* Migration-safe

17. Core Insight
Most language apps fail because:
* They teach isolated vocabulary
* They teach boring sentences
* They ignore visual cognition
* They ignore conversation psychology
MandarinOS solves all four.
