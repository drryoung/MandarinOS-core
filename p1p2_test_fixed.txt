P1ΓåÆP2 TRANSITION TEST SUMMARY
======================================================================

Γ£à PASSED: 19 checks
   Γ£à high_confidence: Confidence correct ('high' from 6/6 gold)
   Γ£à high_confidence: Signals collected (7 unique patterns)
   Γ£à medium_confidence: Signals collected (7 unique patterns)
   Γ£à low_confidence: Signals collected (6 unique patterns)
   Γ£à P2 declares dependency on P1 (phase ordering guaranteed)
   Γ£à P2 routing is pattern-based (signal triggers configured, no score thresholds)
   Γ£à p2_t1_planning_core: Rubric note includes routing signal marker
   Γ£à P2 engines defined (7 engines: identity, place, family, work, hobby, travel)
   Γ£à identity engine: 3 entry frames defined
   Γ£à place engine: 4 entry frames defined
   Γ£à family engine: 3 entry frames defined
   Γ£à High-confidence P1 signals route to identity engine (reciprocal greetings + name + nationality)
   ... and 7 more

ΓÜá∩╕Å  WARNINGS: 5 items
   ΓÜá∩╕Å  medium_confidence: Confidence is 'high' from 5/6 gold (note: p1_yesno accepts both yes/no as gold responses)
   ΓÜá∩╕Å  low_confidence: Confidence is 'medium' from 3/6 gold (note: p1_yesno accepts both yes/no as gold responses)
   ΓÜá∩╕Å  p2_t2_opinion_reason: Rubric note may lack explicit routing signal
   ΓÜá∩╕Å  p2_t3_story_two_steps: Rubric note may lack explicit routing signal
   ΓÜá∩╕Å  P2 overall_progression mentions gatekeeping
