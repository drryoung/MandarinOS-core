MandarinOS — Phase Boundaries & Locked Subsystems
(Reusable Guardrail Document v1.0)

Purpose
-------
This document defines what may and may not be designed, modified, or re-interpreted within each development phase of MandarinOS.

Its goal is to prevent duplication, conceptual drift, and category erosion by clearly separating:
- locked system law
- subsystem ownership
- phase-specific scope

This document is binding for all future phase planning.

--------------------------------------------------

1. System Law (Always Locked)

1.1 Design Constitution
- MandarinOS is a Conversational Acquisition Engine
- Learning occurs through live interaction, not lessons
- No quiz logic, grading, or learning-management metaphors
- No teacher voice or pedagogical meta-commentary
- Audio-first orientation
- Conversation primacy over content primacy

Rule:
New features are evaluated against the Constitution; the Constitution is never reinterpreted to fit features.

--------------------------------------------------

1.2 Hint Cascade Directive
- H0–H3 semantic ladder (Nudge → Narrow → Structure → Model)
- Hints must be actionable via measurable state deltas
- Text-only hints are invalid
- No single “correct answer”
- Monotonic forward progress
- Harness-enforced validators are authoritative

Rule:
Hint semantics define “way forward now”. UI affordances may not replace or bypass the hint ladder.

--------------------------------------------------

1.3 SRS Engine (Locked Subsystem)
- Purpose: silent spaced repetition derived from conversation
- Input: trace / reducer events only
- Output: future conversational resurfacing
- No user-managed queues, saving, or study modes
- Not a UI concern

Rule:
SRS is a downstream consumer. UI phases must not introduce learning-management features that duplicate or compete with it.

--------------------------------------------------

1.4 Trace + Reducer Model
- Trace-driven, reducer-driven state changes
- Race-safe event handling
- Deterministic replay
- Schema stability is prioritised over elegance

Rule:
Phases may add trace events, but not refactor schemas or control flow without explicit reopening.

--------------------------------------------------

2. Phase Ownership Model

Each phase has one primary responsibility and must not absorb responsibilities owned by other phases or subsystems.

Phase 1:
- Owns: Core engine + diagnostics
- Must NOT own: UI pedagogy

Phase 2 (A–C):
- Owns: Runtime card mechanics
- Must NOT own: Learning semantics

Phase 3:
- Owns: Conversation fidelity & hint embodiment
- Must NOT own: Learning management

Phase 4+:
- Owns: Adaptive sequencing & refinement
- Must NOT own: Redefining system law

--------------------------------------------------

3. Phase 3 — Explicit Scope (Reference)

Phase 3 Owns:
- Conversation fidelity
  - Audio-first rendering (cards, modeled options)
  - Speakable outputs
- Hint ladder embodiment
  - H0–H3 effects clearly reflected in UI state
  - No dead states
- Instrumentation completeness
  - Trace events sufficient for downstream consumers (e.g. SRS)

Phase 3 Does NOT Own:
- Saving / bookmarking / review queues
- Curriculum structure
- Study modes
- Repetition scheduling
- Progress dashboards

Rule:
If a feature implies “learn this later”, it is out of Phase 3 scope.

--------------------------------------------------

4. Interaction Rule (Critical)

When evaluating any new feature proposal:
1) Does this preserve live conversational ontology?
2) Does this duplicate the responsibility of a locked subsystem?

If conflict exists:
- The feature is rejected
- The locked subsystem is not reinterpreted to accommodate it

--------------------------------------------------

5. Reopening Protocol (Hard Gate)

A locked item may only be reconsidered if explicitly reopened with:
- a stated reason
- defined scope of reconsideration
- downstream impact assessment

Absent this, all locked items are treated as black boxes.

--------------------------------------------------

6. Enforcement Principle

Phase discipline is more important than feature completeness.

MandarinOS protects category integrity by doing less per phase, not more.
