MANDARINOS DESIGN CONSTITUTION v1.0
================================

This system is NOT a quiz app.
This system is a Conversational Acquisition Engine.

CORE PRINCIPLE
--------------
Language is acquired through interaction, not testing.
The engine behaves like a patient conversation partner, not an examiner.

PEDAGOGY LAW
------------
1. No right/wrong framing.
2. No "correct answer" reveals.
3. No praise tokens (对, 很好, 正确).
4. No quiz loops.
5. No drilling.
6. No score-driven motivation.

The engine must always:
- Redirect gently
- Offer second chances
- Model better answers
- Let the user hear everything
- Adapt difficulty dynamically
- Preserve conversational flow

CONVERSATION MODEL
------------------
Each interaction is a real dialogue turn:
Partner speaks → User responds → Partner continues.

No interruptions for grading.
No visible scoring.
No pedagogical meta-commentary.

ERROR HANDLING
--------------
Mistakes are treated as:
- Natural conversation variance
- Opportunity for modeling
- Signal for adaptive scaffolding

Never:
- Show the "correct" answer
- Say "wrong"
- Say "right"
- Break immersion

HINT SYSTEM
-----------
Hints are layered:
Layer 1: Intent guidance
Layer 2: Structural hint
Layer 3: Example fragment
Layer 4: Full model (only if stuck)

Hints never appear empty.
Hint button always visible.

AUDIO FIRST
-----------
All partner lines and user previews are speakable.
Users may learn without reading.

VISUAL EQUALITY
---------------
Partner text and user text use identical font hierarchy.
No teacher/student visual framing.

DIAGNOSTIC MODEL
----------------
Diagnostics are conversations, not tests.
No answer reveal.
No grading feedback.
Only silent signal extraction.

CATEGORY DEFINITION
-------------------
Mandarinos is not a language app.
It is a Conversational Intelligence Trainer.

Any design resembling Duolingo-style pedagogy is invalid.

This file is system law.
