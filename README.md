# MandarinOS (Core)

MandarinOS is a conversation-first Mandarin learning system designed to diagnose and build **usable spoken competence**, not passive vocabulary recognition.

The system is built around:
- Structured dialogue frames
- Adaptive scaffolding
- A multi-layer hint system
- Content packs defined entirely in JSON (portable and migratable

## Guardrails (Read Before Making Changes)

MandarinOS is conversation-first, frame-driven, and learner-centered.
If proposed changes introduce vocabulary-first flows, teacher-style explanations,
or schema refactors “for cleanliness”, stop and re-evaluate.

See MandarinOS Design Constitution for non-negotiable principles.
